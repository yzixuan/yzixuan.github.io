  <h2 class="cyan-color">How I Work</h2>
  <br/>
  <p>I’m <em>agile</em> and I have a strong focus on rapid collaboration and validated learning. I work closely with my colleagues &amp; clients to understand business requirements to develop a solution. In each iteration, I will work with you to validate design decisions and help you incorporate subsequent changes to further improve your product or service.</p>

    <h3>1. User Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I work with you to get insights into the overall need that need to be addressed, and help you understand the current state of your site and your competitors</li>
      <li>I carry out user research through user interviews, surveys or card sorting, and I communicate with you about the needs of your users</li>
      <li>We consolidate needs and ideas from your various stakeholders and potential users, and then coalesce these ideas into requirements</li>
      <li>I prioritize requirements based on the project objectives we’ve identified together</li>

    <h3>2. Wireframing &amp; Annotations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I ideate and visualize features by sketching out rough ideas</li>
      <li>I create wireframes and task flows based on information we collected from design briefs &amp; user research</li>
      <li>I account for responsive design by creating multiple representations of the wireframe for different devices (e.g. mobile and desktop), and work with you to validate these designs</li>

    <h3>3. High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I create mockups using Adobe Illustrator or Sketch, including multiple representations for different devices</li>
      <li>If needed, I animate prototype interactions using Principle too</li>
      <li>I also work with developers to determine feasibility of developing such a prototype, and create assets for handover</li>

    <h3>4. Usability Testing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I create a list of tasks based on the prototype we created together, and get users to perform them</li>
      <li>I note where users have issues and successes with using the prototype</li>
      <li>I go through all consolidated testing results and feedback with you, and we learn to make them better in future iterations</li>
