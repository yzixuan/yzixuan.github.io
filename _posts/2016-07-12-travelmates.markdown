TravelMates is a social itinerary planner and travel community for Free & Easy (F&E) travelers which my team and I designed for a service innovation module we took in the National University of Singapore (NUS). This page showcases a revamped version of the design I did many years back.

TravelMates serves as a single platform that allows F&E travelers to consolidate flights, accommodations and all other trip activities in a single itinerary, as well as introduce social elements to help travelers find companions with similar interests, communicate with fellow trip members and share information before and after the trip.

### Background

Prior to the prevalence of the Internet, trip planning is largely associated with tour agencies who are experts in this domain. It was difficult to plan a trip without easy access to travel information, not to mention the insecurity and unsettling prospect of being lost in a foreign land. Yet springing forward to today's context, F&E traveling is increasingly the method of choice for travelers to conduct their trip. However, F&E travelers tend to rely on disjointed avenues to fulfill their research, transactional and organizational needs, which compromise on the ease of planning their trip.

&nbsp;

### Key Stakeholders:

While there are many stakeholders in the trip planning industry segment, they can generally be grouped into 3 main categories, namely suppliers, tour agencies and travelers.

* **Suppliers**: Suppliers here refer to sectors which tour agencies partner with to deliver the tour package, such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, activity vendors etc.
* **Tour Agencies**: The main service providers of this industry segment are middlemen businesses providing one-stop travel-related services such as booking of tour packages, flights and accommodations. Online Tour Agencies (OTA) such as Travelocity and Expedia are also included in this classification.
* **Travellers**: The potential clients of tour agencies, including anyone who has the intentions of travelling abroad for reasons including holiday-making, business, conference or others.

### The Challenge

Free & Easy traveling is increasingly the method of choice for travelers to conduct their trip. This reflects a change in the travel appetite of tourists in which the current market seems unprepared to address effectively. As a result, F&E travelers currently rely on disjointed avenues to fulfill their research, transactional and organizational needs, which compromise on the ease of planning their trip.

In response, our proposed service innovation will aim to tackle the challenge of streamlining the trip planning process for F&E travelers. This will be achieved by providing a single platform catering to all their needs with particular emphasis on 2 areas currently not addressed by existing offerings. The first would prompt a single consolidated transaction for flights, accommodations and all other trip activities, while the second would see the introduction of social elements to help travelers find companions with similar interests, communicate with fellow trip members and share information before and after the trip.

&nbsp;

### Target Users

While we have three key stakeholders as explained earlier, the primary users of the TravelMates portal would generally be F&E travelers themselves. Although the availability of information over the Internet has made it easier for F&E travelers to plan their own trips, the process of doing so is certainly not an easy one.

Anyone who has been involved in such a planning process should be able to identify with the hassle brought about from the following 5 typical tasks in F&E trip planning:

1. Reference available itineraries for inspiration
2. Search for interesting activities through various sources
3. Book flights, accommodations & activities separately
4. Organize and consolidate all trip information, documents and instructions
5. Communicate trip details with fellow trip partners

&nbsp;

### Search for Hotels, Flights & Trip Activities

Our portal should allow users to search for information on TravelMates by entering a few keywords and selecting the categories of interest. Relevant results will be displayed in a list of activities ranked by relevance, and sorted by popularity, price or name.

Searching for activities to do during trips as well as itineraries planned by others for reference are typically the central processes to F&E trip planning. Hence this service allows users to search for information on TravelMates by entering a few keywords and selecting the categories of interest. Relevant results will be displayed in a list of activities ranked by relevance, and sorted by popularity, price or name. Each activity listing is then accompanied with key information such as the address, opening hours and the average rating provided by TravelMates’ users.  Full itineraries that have been planned and shared by other users may also be searched for in a similar fashion.

### Trip Itinerary Planner

A trip itinerary planner would allow users to select and organize activities by simply dragging and dropping activities from the search list into specific time slots in the schedule. We also thought that the backend system should actively help to ensure that there are no clashes in activity timings while multiple versions of such itineraries may be saved for future reference.

Travelers may also choose to share any of these itineraries with the online community or to their accounts in other social media platforms. Conversely, they may also reference and import itineraries shared by other travellers to the itinerary planner as a base for their own trip planning purposes.

&nbsp;

To allow other travelers to join this trip, travelers may also opt to make this trip public, by invitation only, or totally private. At any point in time thereafter, users can receive updates from fellow trip members who have joined their trips as well as make comments or add activities to the shared itinerary.

F&E travelers are typically of the more adventurous type that desires flexibility of their itinerary and control over elements of their trip. While planning a trip based on individual research and separate booking of activities, accommodations and flights might offer the flexibility that F&E travelers seek, it necessarily sacrifices the convenience that the travel agencies have to offer. However, with the implementation of TravelMates, this will no longer be a significant compromise as travel information and transactions with individual activity suppliers are congregated through a single point of research, booking, payment and point of reference.

### Review Trip Activities & Travel-Related Content

To encourage active usage and provide alternative perspectives, TravelMates could help to collate reviews and user-contributed information for each activity listed on TravelMates. By allowing users to rate other users’ reviews as well, the platform reaches out to the masses for help in maintaining the integrity and quality of information available on the platform. Any reviews that fail automated system checks will be suspended while pending moderation by TravelMates staff.

### Final Thoughts

While TravelMates is just a hypothetical web app for a service science module, I had tons of fun designing the mockups with my teammates and addressing the gaps in the trip planning industry as a team. While the effort required in the implementation of TravelMates may raise doubts over its viability, we believe that its social elements and hassle-free approach would redefine the way F&E trip planning is done.
