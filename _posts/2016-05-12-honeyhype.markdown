### What's HoneyHype?

HoneyHype is a platform for Indie and upcoming food brands to connect with influential Instagrammers (i.e. social media influencers) who can help them to publicize their products on their social media channels.

Here, brands can better focus on their audience by attracting influencers with a large follower base to help promote their products and get feedback. They will also be able to understand and analyze their market reach and sentiment.

On the other hand, social media influencers can negotiate the perks received by themselves and their followers, which allows them to play an active role in championing the brands they care about.

### Target Users

HoneyHype aims to bridge the needs of 2 types of users - niche food brands and influential Instagram users.
We aim to help food brands that wish to give their businesses extra exposure on social media channels such as Instagram and hopefully attract customers from social media savvy groups. We try to achieve this by connecting brands to social media influencers who actively post sponsored content on their channels that serve as their followers' go-to source of information and recommendation.

### Landing Page

During my brief stint, I worked with my client over a few iterations to produce a single-page landing site. This was the (more-or-less) finalized design. As HoneyHype was a relatively novel concept, it could not just be any other generic landing page. It also had to explain to potential users how the platform works and how it could benefit them, but the explanation had to be simple as well.

### Campaign Exploration

Influencers can search for existing campaigns posted by food brands and offer to help publicize their products.

By joining a campaign, the Influencer agrees to make an advertorial post for the food brand's product on his/her social media channels (in this case, Instagram). In exchange for promoting the brands' products, the Influencer receives some perks in return, while the food brand gains extra publicity for their product.

### Food Brands' Campaign Management

Food brands can create and manage their social media campaigns and their Influencers' advertorial post for each campaign.

We also want to make it flexible for food brand owners to create their own campaign. The campaign creation process involves guiding the food brand owner in setting campaign and assignment instructions, and then helping them find Instagrammers to publicize their product.
