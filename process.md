title: My Design Process

Iâ€™m *agile* and I have a strong focus on rapid collaboration and validated learning. I work closely with my colleagues & clients to understand business requirements to develop a solution. In each iteration, I validate design decisions with my clients to incorporate subsequent changes to further improve the product.

### 1. User Requirements

* Get insight into the overall need that must be addressed, and understand the current state of the site and its competitors
* Carry out user research through user interviews, surveys or card sorting, or communicate with the client about the needs of the user
* Consolidate needs and ideas from various stakeholders and potential user
* Coalesce ideas into requirements
* Prioritize requirements based on project objectives

&nbsp;

### 2. Wireframing & Annotations

* Ideate and visualize features by sketching out rough ideas
* Create wireframes and task flows based on information collected from design briefs & user research
* Account for responsive design by creating multiple representations of the wireframe for different devices (e.g. mobile and desktop)

&nbsp;

### 3. High-Fidelity Prototyping

* Create mockups using Adobe Illustrator or Sketch 3.0, including multiple representations for different devices
* Animate prototype interactions using Principle if needed
* Work with developers to determine feasibility of developing such a prototype, and create assets for handover

&nbsp;

### 4. User Testing

* Conduct internal testing with clients and developers
* Conduct qualitative research with end users
* Validate design decisions and learn to make them better in future iterations
