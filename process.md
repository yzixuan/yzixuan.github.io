Iâ€™m *agile* and I have a strong focus on rapid collaboration and validated learning. I work closely with my colleagues & clients to understand business requirements to develop a solution. In each iteration, I will work with you to validate design decisions and help you incorporate subsequent changes to further improve your product or service.

### 1. User Requirements

* I work with you to get insights into the overall need that need to be addressed, and help you understand the current state of your site and your competitors
* I carry out user research through user interviews, surveys or card sorting, and I communicate with you about the needs of your users
* We consolidate needs and ideas from your various stakeholders and potential users, and then coalesce these ideas into requirements
* I prioritize requirements based on the project objectives we've identified together

&nbsp;

### 2. Wireframing & Annotations

* I ideate and visualize features by sketching out rough ideas
* I create wireframes and task flows based on information we collected from design briefs & user research
* I account for responsive design by creating multiple representations of the wireframe for different devices (e.g. mobile and desktop), and work with you to validate these designs

&nbsp;

### 3. High-Fidelity Prototyping

* I create mockups using Adobe Illustrator or Sketch, including multiple representations for different devices
* If needed, I animate prototype interactions using Principle too
* I also work with developers to determine feasibility of developing such a prototype, and create assets for handover

&nbsp;

### 4. User Testing

* I create a list of user tasks based on the prototype we created together
* I help you conduct testing with your potential end users
* I go through all consolidated testing results and feedback with you, and we learn to make them better in future iterations
